# Lab 3
Please put all front-end files in the folder named `frontend` and all back-end files in the folder named `backend`.

Put all your front-end assets in `frontend/img` and back-end assets in `backend/data` folders. Git will ignore content in these folders and you must manually copy them to the server when you are deploying.
